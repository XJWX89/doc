## Thor.Decoded

`Decoded` is a mixed object that produced by `ABI.decode` with the ABI definition of `EVENT` or `METHOD`. Decoded will be present only at the ABI definition is provided.

+ {index} - `number`: Decoded property by parameter index
+ {name} - `string`: Decoded property by parameter name if any
+ `revertReason` - `string(optional)`: Reason message when method call reverted. It's usually the second argument of `require` statement in Solidity, and helpful to diagnose contract code.

For example if a method's definition is `function name() public pure returns(string name)` after perform the simulate call `decoded` will be like following: 

``` javascript
{
    "0": "VeThor",
    "name": "VeThor"
}
```

You can access the name by calling `decoded['name']` or `decoded['0']`(Number index is for non-named outputs).

Another example if an event's definition is `event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)` after performing the filter `decoded` will be the following: 

``` javascript
{
    "0": "0x7567D83b7b8d80ADdCb281A71d54Fc7B3364ffed",
    "1": "0x00F34f4462c0f6a6f5E76Fb1b6D63F05A32eD2C6",
    "2": "1000000000000000000",
    "_from": "0x7567D83b7b8d80ADdCb281A71d54Fc7B3364ffed",
    "_to": "0x00F34f4462c0f6a6f5E76Fb1b6D63F05A32eD2C6",
    "_value": "1000000000000000000"
}
```
