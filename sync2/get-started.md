## VeChain Sync2 
 **Sync2** is designed to work with all mainstream web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Safari, MS Edge, Firefox, etc), desktop, and mobile devices.

The main advantage and purpose of Sync2 is the massive simplification of dApps and dApp usage. All editions of Sync2, no matter whether the native app built for desktop or mobile or the automatically invoked SPA version, are designed to appear and function pretty much in the same way, therefore providing a consistent and comfortable user experience for users across different OS and devices.
