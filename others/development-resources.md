## Public Nodes
Public nodes allow you to test all the features without setting up your own node. Below are the available nodes for development and testing.

- Mainnet: 
  
  - [https://vethor-node.vechain.com](https://vethor-node.vechain.com/)- *provided by VeChain Foundation*
  - [VeBlocks Public Nodes](https://github.com/mirei83/VeChain-PublicNodes)- *provided by VeBlocks*

- Testnet:
