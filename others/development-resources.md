- [Energy Station(Testnet Only)](https://energy.outofgas.io/) - A demo allows you to exchange energy(VeThor) and VET on VeChain Thor blockchain.
  
- [My-tokens](https://tokens.vecha.in/) - A demo allows you to transfer tokens

## Public Services
- [Testnet faucet](https://faucet.vecha.in/) - Provides VET and VTHO on testnet freely. It is designed to help developers test applications as well as provide users an alternative to experience dApps on the VeChainThor blockchain

- [App-hub](https://github.com/vechain/app-hub) - a platform that allow you to submit your awesome app and discovery by people around the world.
  
- [B32](https://github.com/vechain/b32) - Signature collection of smart contract method & event
  
- [Connex-env](https://github.com/vechain/connex-env) - The landing page leads user to download Connex powered VeChain wallets

- [Picasso](https://github.com/vechain/picasso#vanilla-js) - General purpose deterministic identity icon library in svg format, mostly for VeChain thor addresses.

## Public Nodes
Public nodes allow you to test all the features without setting up your own node. Below are the available nodes for development and testing.

- Mainnet: 
  
  - [https://vethor-node.vechain.com](https://vethor-node.vechain.com/)- *provided by VeChain Foundation*
  - [VeBlocks Public Nodes](https://github.com/mirei83/VeChain-PublicNodes)- *provided by VeBlocks*

- Testnet: 
  
  - [https://vethor-node-test.vechaindev.com](https://vethor-node-test.vechaindev.com/)- *provided by VeChain Foundation*
  - [VeBlocks Public Nodes](https://github.com/mirei83/VeChain-PublicNodes)- *provided by VeBlocks*

:::tip Note
1. The public nodes are not designed for the production environment, and VeChain Foundation does not guarantee the reliability and availability.

2. VeBlocks Public Nodes is a community project to support all developers and allow them everywhere-access to the blockchain, without the need to have a full node with them. For more information, please visit [VeBlocks Public Nodes](https://github.com/mirei83/VeChain-PublicNodes)
